# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added — 2026-10-23

- CI `migrate` job: applies `supabase/migrations/` to the live project on push to `main` after
  all checks pass.
- `scripts/check-migrations.sh`: CI fails on edits to applied migrations or out-of-order new ones.
- Root scripts `pnpm db:login`, `pnpm db:types`; root `.env.example` for the project ref.

### Changed — 2026-10-23

- `packages/db` now has real types generated from the live project; removed the temporary cast in
  `apps/fincrew-web/src/lib/session.ts`.
- `scripts/db-types.mjs` validates the project ref and no longer triggers Node's DEP0190 warning.
- Supabase CLI moved from `supabase/` package to the repo root; `packages/db` `gen:types`
  replaced by `pnpm db:types`.
- `docs/SETUP.md` reordered: Supabase project → GitHub secrets → push (migrations apply) →
  owner login.

### Added — 2026-10-22 (Phase 1: Foundation)

- Monorepo: Turborepo + pnpm; `apps/fincrew-web`, `packages/{core,db,ui,i18n}`, `supabase/`.
- `packages/core`: paise money helpers (`formatINR`, `roundToRupee`, `rupeesToPaise`), IST
  business dates, permission keys.
- Database: shops, people, roles and permissions, audit log, RLS helpers, owner protection,
  shop setup, keep-awake ping.
